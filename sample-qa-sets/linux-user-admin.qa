['What is the file /etc/shadow, what does it do?','/etc/shadow file stores actual password in encrypted format for user's account with additional properties related to user password i.e. it stores secure user account information. All fields are separated by a colon (:) symbol. It contains one entry per line for each user listed in /etc/passwd file .']

['What are guid,euid,ruid,and suid?','Group user id,effective user id,real user id, and saved user id']
['Explain what euid is:','The effective user id, determines the accesss level of a given process/file.']
['Explain what ruid is:','Real user id is the access level/id of a logged in user.  It can\'t be changed within a session.']
['What is fsuid?','File system user id: used explicitly for access control to the file system. It matches the euid unless explicitly set otherwise. It may be root's user ID only if ruid, suid, or euid is root. Whenever the euid is changed, the change is propagated to the fsuid.
The intent of fsuid is to permit programs (e.g. the NFS server) to limit themselves to the file system rights of some given uid without giving that uid permission to send them signals.]
['What are setuid and setgid used for?','setuid and setgid (short for "set user ID upon execution" and "set group ID upon execution", respectively)[1] are Unix access rights flags that allow users to run an executable with the permissions of the executable's owner or group respectively and to change behaviour in directories. They are often used to allow users on a computer system to run programs with temporarily elevated privileges in order to perform a specific task. While the assumed user id or group id privileges provided are not always elevated, at a minimum they are specific.']
['Explain the file /etc/passwd','etc/passwd file stores essential information, which is required during login i.e. user account information. /etc/passwd is a text file, that contains a list of the system's accounts, giving for each account some useful information like user ID, group ID, home directory, shell, etc. It should have general read permission as many utilities, like ls use it to map user IDs to user names, but write access only for the superuser (root).']
